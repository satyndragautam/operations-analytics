# ⚙️ Operations Analytics

With prior experience as a business analyst and a background in completing multiple projects in this field, I wanted to stay updated and connected with my existing operations analytics skills while awaiting a work permit after moving to the US. So, I undertook this project to polish and regain my analytical skill through this certification program, which helped me enhance my abilities into how to utilize various frameworks and ideas into a spectrum of real-world business challenges, and how to transform raw data into actionable insights for making profitable decisions in regard to achieving operational efficiency within a business setting. The primary focus was to develop a deep understanding and knowledge around the corner and apply efficient methodologies and techniques to build predictive models to choose the best course of action in the face of risk while highlighting the future uncertainties. This course also helped me improve my skills in different types of forecasting methods, the newsvendor problem, regression analysis, random demand variability, operation research, optimization, seasonality, and de-seasonality and more.

Please Note: During this program, there were multiple hands-on exercises and hands-on projects done using the speadsheets. I will add them here in this repo for a better visibility in upcoming months.
